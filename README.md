# Employee Directory (React based)

Hosted at https://moullier.github.io/employee-directory/

## Description

This is a simple employee directory with the user interface created in React.  The program uses an API call using Axois to randomuser.me to generate 10 random employees, and then displays their information in a table.  The table can be sorted by the employee's age (ascending, descending or left unsorted), and it can be filtered by the employee's name.  These two functions can be used together or separately.

The application was created with create-react-app and deployed to github pages.  It is styled with Bootstrap and Font Awesome was used for a few icons.
